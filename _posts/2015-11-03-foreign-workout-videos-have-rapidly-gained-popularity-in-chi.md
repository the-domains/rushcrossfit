Foreign workout videos have rapidly gained popularity in China where "fitness fever" has swept the nation. Last month, Shanghai office lady Zhu Ling posted a photo on WeChat of herself in a yellow sports bra, flaunting firm, flat abs and shapely, muscular arms. The picture quickly gained more than 40 "thumbs ups" from friends, with some praising her "model-like" figure. Zhu says positive feedback from her friends motivates her to stick to her daily exercise routine using an aerobics workout video by South Korean fitness guru Jung Da-yeon. "Almost every girl in my office does aerobics with Jung," Zhu, 28, said. "We do it at least four days a week in our meeting room during lunch break. It's simple, effective and easy to do at home or in the office."
